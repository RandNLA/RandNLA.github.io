# RandNLA Proof Wiki Home

Welcome to the Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra (RandNLA) Proof Wiki.
The goal of this site is to catalogue the most clean and essential proofs used in the RandNLA literature.
This website is a work-in-progress, and if you see something you would like to change, then reach out to [Raphael Meyer](https://ram900.hosting.nyu.edu) at _ram900@nyu.edu_.

Keep in mind that this site emphasizes simplicity and minimalism in proofs.
We aim to be clear and concise.
If two results use very similar proofs then we will only present one of those proofs, and only mention or cite the only.

You can browse the list of all proofs below this section.
If you would like to submit an additional proof, then read our page on [contributing](/contributing/).
In addition these proofs, we also list many useful and several hard-to-find theorems at the bottom of this page.
